Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/), where I am very fortunate to be supervised by [Dr. Arthur Gervais](https://arthurgervais.com/). I also work closely with [Prof. Dawn Song](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dawnsong/) at [UC Berkeley RDI](https://rdi.berkeley.edu/) and [Liyi Zhou](https://lzhou1110.github.io/) at Imperial College London.

My academic interests center around designing and building decentralized systems that are secure, stable, and incentive-compatible. The inherent complexity of real-world decentralized systems, with their interdependent and interacting layers, poses a fascinating challenge in achieving this objective. My primary focus is on permissionless blockchains and decentralized finance (DeFi).
In my research, I aim to systematically measure and quantify various problems encountered in the rapidly evolving blockchain and DeFi ecosystems. I also strive to develop real-time offensive and defensive solutions by utilizing advanced program analysis techniques to enhance smart contract security. Furthermore, I intend to devise innovative financial primitives that minimize the systemic risks of DeFi. My research is informed by the fields of security, program analysis, measurement, and finance. I am also actively exploring the application of machine learning and game theory to my research pursuits.
